# Multiplayer Roguelike Client
 A multiplayer Roguelike Playground to experiment with some cutting edge concepts.

 The main point of this project is to rapidly prototype out features for it's bigger brother, *Sullen Stars: The Video Game*. To that end, the most important aspect of this project is that it is elegant and clean. Files should be 66% code, 33% comments. Classes should be short and elegant, with multiline comments under the start of methods, and single line comments under statements. 

 Additionally, The assets allowed are contrained to the ASCII sheet, the entities sheet, and the ASCII font provided. This client should never exceed 200 Megabytes when compiled into an executable.
