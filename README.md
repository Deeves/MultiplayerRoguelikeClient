# Multiplayer Roguelike Client
 A multiplayer Roguelike Playground to experiment with some cutting edge concepts.

 The main point of this project is to rapidly prototype out features for it's bigger brother, *Sullen Stars: The Video Game*. To that end, the most important aspect of this project is that it is elegant and clean. Files should be 60% code, 30% comments. Classes should be short and elegant, with multiline comments under the start of methods, and single line comments under statements.
